# Day 4 — General notes (Beginner)

This folder contains my Day 4 notes while learning Dart. I'm new to Dart, so these notes are written for beginners and include simple reminders, how to run the example, and practice exercises.

Files
- `general.dart` — (present) a small example or collection of snippets I tried on Day 4. Open it to see the code and comments.

What I focused on today
- Reviewing basic syntax and structure for Dart files
- Practicing simple functions, control flow, or combining small snippets (check `general.dart`)
- Running Dart scripts from the command line

How to run the example
1. Install the Dart SDK if you haven't already: https://dart.dev/get-dart
2. Open a terminal in this folder (`day 4`) and run:

```powershell
dart run general.dart
```

Notes & tips
- If your editor supports Dart (VS Code with the Dart extension), it will show helpful linting and quick fixes.
- Use `dart analyze` in the repository root to run the analyzer and see warnings or errors.

Exercises to try
1. Read `general.dart` and add comments explaining each line in your own words.
2. Extract a small function from `general.dart` and call it with different arguments.
3. Introduce a bug intentionally (like a type mismatch) to see how the analyzer reports it, then fix it.

Helpful resources
- Dart language tour: https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour
- Using Dart on the command line: https://dart.dev/get-dart

Next steps
- Add more small example files for functions, lists, and maps so each concept is easy to re-run.
- Optionally, I can create unit tests for the small functions you write.

If you'd like, I can create a short `general_example_test.dart` and show how to run `dart test` — tell me and I will add it.
