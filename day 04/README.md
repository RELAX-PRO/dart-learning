# Day 4 — General notes (Beginner)

This folder contains my Day 4 notes while learning Dart.

Files
- `general.dart` — (present) a small example or collection of snippets I tried on Day 4. Open it to see the code and comments.

What I focused on today
- Reviewing basic syntax and structure for Dart files
- Practicing simple functions, control flow, or combining small snippets (check `general.dart`)
- Running Dart scripts from the command line

Helpful resources
